# Main-Project
This project is based on Modelling CPU-temperature for efficient deployment of tasks in IoT platform. This project's objective is to forecastthe heat produced during a task and balance that task that will generate
less heat, hence preventing overheating. In this project we are using Odroid-XU4 board which consists of 1.3 and 2 ghz processors containing 2 core each respectively.
